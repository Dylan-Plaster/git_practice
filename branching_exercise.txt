Branching exercise:
Part 1:
1. git checkout -b <name of branch> creates a new branch
2. a fast forward merge is when there are no commits on the original/master
branch while the new branch is being worked on.
3. git checkout <name of branch> changes to another branch
4. git branch -d <name of branch> deletes a merged branch, and 
git branch -D <name of branch> deletes a branch regardless of whether 
it has been merged or not.
5. merge conflicts happen when there are changes to the same file or folder
on the master branch and the new branch that have been committed. git 
cannot determine which of the changes is intended to be in the merged branch.
