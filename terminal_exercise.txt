Terminal Exercise:
Part 1:
1. mkdir first
2. cd first
3. touch person.txt
4. mv person.txt another.txt
5. cp another.txt copy.txt
6. rm copy.txt
7. cp -r first second
8. rm -rf second

Part 2:
1. The man command brings up additional information on the command you give it.
to navigate, space or f advances one page, d or control d advances half a page
b or control b goes back a page, and u or control u goes back half a page.

2. The '-l' flag lists files with more details than ls does, and the 
'-a' tag lists all files and folders in the current directory,
including hidden ones.

3. 'alt+left/right' jumps between words in the terminal

4. 'control+e' jumps to the end of the line in the terminal.

5. 'control+a' jumps to the beginning of the line in the terminal.

6. select the end of the word and press 'alt+delete' to delete a word

7. The terminal is the window on the coumputer you type into, the shell is
the program which processes the commands typed into the terminal.

8. An absolute path is the complete path to the location of the file or
folder in question. Absolute path can be used to get to any folder/file
from any place, whereas a relative path is only relative to the current location.
The absolute path starts from the root.

9. A relative path starts at your current location instead of the root.
This can be used to access files and folders within the current directory
and nested directories.

10. A flag adds additional information to a command to tell the terminal/shell
exactly what we want to be returned. I have used the '-a' and '-l' flags
with the ls command, and the '-r' and '-f' flags with the rm command.

11. the '-r' flag will remove folders and go through each folder and 
file and remove them, and '-f' will force the removal of these elements.
